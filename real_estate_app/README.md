# Real Estate Mobile App

This example uses [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with
[Expo](https://expo.dev/) to provide a simple application for posting
real estate listings. The app lets you enter a property title and price,
add it to a local list and display all added listings.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) (install via `npm install -g expo-cli`)

## Running the App

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Use the Expo app on your phone or an emulator to run the project.

This is a minimal example intended as a starting point. You can extend
it with user authentication, image uploads and a backend service to
store listings permanently.
